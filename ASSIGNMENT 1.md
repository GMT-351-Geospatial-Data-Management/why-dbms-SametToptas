**Explain why we need a DataBase Management System (DBMS) instead of a spreadsheet ?**
	If you work in a large company or a public institution, you will probably need a Database Management System (DBMS). Because Database Management Systems facilitate processes such as storing, changing and protecting large-scale data. The spreadsheet system may not always be able to store large scale data of large companies or public institutions because it is limited, but DBMS is a software system dependent on computer capacity. We can solve the multiple data storage of DBMS by powering our computer, but we may lose or reduce data while trying to find a solution to this in the spreadsheet system. DBMS is an open source system, so data is easily accessed and managed by third parties and those who administer the system. Also, the Database Management System has various software. For example, MySQL is the software most preferred by web servers. If we are going to do a large-scale project, the project will be more institutional and beneficial as we can benefit from various software.

**What are the advantages of using a DBMS (and Postgres in particular) compared to a spreadsheet (MS Excel in particular) ?**
- stores detailed and more data.
- It is safer to store data.
- can make simple calculations.
- data recovery is possible.
- multiple access to data is possible.

**What are the disadvantages of using a DBMS (and Postgres in particular) compared to a spreadsheet (MS Excel in particular) ?**
- Database Management System software installation and maintenance costs are higher.
- Simple data editing and selection operations are more difficult than Spreadsheet.
